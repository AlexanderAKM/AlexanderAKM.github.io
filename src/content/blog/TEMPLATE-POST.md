<!-- Copy your Obsidian content below this line -->

## Your Heading

Your content goes here. This is just a template to show the required frontmatter.

### Important Notes About Images

For images from Obsidian:
1. Replace `![[image.jpg]]` with `![Alt text](/images/image.jpg)`
2. Copy your images to the `public/images/` folder of the website

### Important Notes About Links

For links from Obsidian:
1. Replace `[[Internal Link]]` with `[Internal Link](/blog/internal-link)`
2. External links like `[text](url)` will work as-is

### Important Notes About Callouts

Obsidian callouts need to be replaced with HTML:

> [!NOTE]
> This is a note callout from Obsidian

Becomes:

<div class="callout callout-note">
This is a note callout from Obsidian
</div>
